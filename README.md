## Simple Music Visualization

The result of messing around with **p5.js** and its sound module  
It analyzes the input and reflects the energy got from it through colors and opacity. It's very simple approach and you'll notice that if you look at the code.  
To add more natural movements I have also used **Perlin Noise**.  
About the music, it's a simple improvisation that I came up with while I was playing, it's not perfect and it's full of errors.  
It still has a lot to improve, though.
