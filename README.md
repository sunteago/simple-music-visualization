### Simple Music Visualization

The result of messing around with p5.js and the sound module p5.sound.js  
It analyzes the input and reflects the energy got from it through colors and opacity. It's very simple approach and you'll notice that if you look at the code.  
To add more natural movements I also used Perlin Noise.  
About the default music, it's a simple improvisation I that I made messing around, it's not perfect and it's full of errors.
It still has a lot to improve, though.
